## 🔑 How It Works: Bring Your Own Key

SprachNinja uses a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. To use the AI features, you need to get a **free API key** from **Google AI Studio**.

1.  Visit [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Click "**Create API key**".
3.  Copy the generated key.
4.  Paste it into the **Settings** screen in the SprachNinja app.

This approach ensures that your usage is private and you have full control over the API calls made from your device.

## ⚙️ Building From Source

If you want to build the project yourself, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vpk11/SprachNinja.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    Open the cloned project in the latest version of Android Studio.
3.  **Build the project:**
    Let Gradle sync and build the project.
4.  **Run the app:**
    Run on an emulator or a physical device. You will need to add your own Gemini API key in the app's settings screen to enable the learning features.
